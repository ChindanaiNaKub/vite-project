# Create Auction Feature - Implementation Guide

## What Was Missing?

Your application had **auction listing** but **no way to create new auctions**. I've now added the complete "Create Auction" feature!

## What Was Added

### 1. **New Auction Form View** (`src/views/AuctionFormView.vue`)
A complete form to create auction items with:
- **Description** field (textarea)
- **Type/Category** field (e.g., Electronics, Art, Collectibles)
- **Starting Bid** field (optional, numeric)
- **Submit** and **Cancel** buttons
- **Live preview** of the auction data
- **Error handling** for authentication (must be logged in)

### 2. **Updated Auction Service** (`src/services/AuctionService.ts`)
Added new method:
```typescript
saveAuctionItem(auctionItem: Partial<AuctionItem>): Promise<AxiosResponse<AuctionItem>>
```
This sends a POST request to `/auction-items` to create new auctions.

### 3. **Updated Router** (`src/router/index.ts`)
Added new route:
```typescript
{
  path: '/add-auction',
  name: 'add-auction',
  component: AuctionFormView
}
```

### 4. **Updated Navigation** (`src/App.vue`)
Added "New Auction" link in the header (visible only to admins):
```
Event | Organizations | About | New Event | Auctions | New Auction
```

## Where to Find It

### Navigation Menu
When you're logged in as an **admin**, you'll see:
```
Event | Organizations | About | New Event | Auctions | New Auction | [admin icon] [LogOut]
                                               ^                ^
                                          View auctions    Create new auction
```

### Direct URL
You can also navigate directly to:
```
http://localhost:5173/add-auction
```

## How to Use

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Log In as Admin**
- You must be logged in with **admin role** to see the "New Auction" link
- If you're not logged in, the link won't appear in the navigation

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Click "New Auction"**
- Navigate to the "New Auction" link in the header
- You'll see the auction creation form

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Fill in the Form**
```
Description: Vintage camera in excellent condition
Type: Electronics
Starting Bid: 100.00
```

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Submit**
- Click "Create Auction Item" button
- If successful: redirects to auction list with success message
- If not logged in: shows error message and redirects to login

### ‚úÖ **Step 5: View Your New Auction**
- After creation, you're redirected to `/auctions`
- Your new auction item will appear in the list
- You can search for it using the smart search feature

## Form Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Description** | Textarea | ‚úÖ Yes | Detailed description of the auction item |
| **Type/Category** | Text | ‚úÖ Yes | Category like "Electronics", "Art", "Collectibles" |
| **Starting Bid** | Number | ‚ùå No | Optional starting bid amount (default: 0) |

## Example Auction Items to Create

### Example 1: Electronics
```
Description: MacBook Pro 2020, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, excellent condition
Type: Electronics
Starting Bid: 800.00
```

### Example 2: Art
```
Description: Original oil painting by local artist, 24x36 inches, framed
Type: Art
Starting Bid: 500.00
```

### Example 3: Collectibles
```
Description: Rare baseball card collection from the 1990s, mint condition
Type: Collectibles
Starting Bid: 250.00
```

### Example 4: Sports
```
Description: Signed Neymar Jr. soccer jersey from 2023 World Cup
Type: Sports
Starting Bid: 1500.00
```

## Authentication Requirements

### Backend Security
The backend requires JWT authentication for creating auctions:
- ‚úÖ **GET** `/auction-items` - Public, no login needed
- üîí **POST** `/auction-items` - Requires admin login

### Error Handling
If you try to create an auction without being logged in:
1. Shows message: "You must be logged in to create an auction item"
2. Waits 2 seconds
3. Redirects to login page
4. After login, you can return to create the auction

## File Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AuctionListView.vue      ‚Üê View all auctions (existing)
