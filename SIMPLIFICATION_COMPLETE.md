## ✅ Verification Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| TypeScript Compilation | ✅ PASS |
| No Lint Errors | ✅ PASS |
| Auth Store Simplified | ✅ PASS |
| Interceptor Simplified | ✅ PASS |
| Token Refresh Removed | ✅ PASS |
| Code Matches Lab | ✅ PASS |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start Fresh (Recommended)
```bash
# Clear old data in browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
```

### 2. Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Login
- Go to: http://localhost:5173/login
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`
- Should redirect to event list
- Should stay logged in after F5 refresh

## 🎓 What You Can Do Now

✅ Login with credentials  
✅ Stay logged in after page refresh  
✅ See role-based UI (admin vs user)  
✅ Make authenticated API calls  
✅ Logout cleanly  
✅ Understand the code easily  

---

## 🐛 Known Behaviors (Not Bugs!)

### Token Expiry
- Tokens expire after 24 hours (backend setting)
- No auto-refresh (not in lab requirements)
- **Solution**: Just logout and login again

### 403 Errors
- If you see 403 errors, token may be expired
- **Solution**: Clear localStorage and login again

### Session State
- Auth state loads from localStorage on app startup
- **Location**: App.vue script setup
- **Simple**: Just 3 lines of code!

## 🔍 Testing Guide

### Basic Flow Test
```bash
1. Clear storage (localStorage.clear())
2. Go to /login
3. Login with admin/admin
4. Check navbar shows "admin"
5. Check "New Event" menu visible
6. Press F5
7. Still logged in? ✅
8. Click logout
9. Redirected to login? ✅
10. localStorage cleared? ✅
```

### API Call Test
```bash
1. Login successfully
2. Open Network tab (F12)
3. Navigate to events
4. Check requests have:
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
5. Responses successful? ✅
```

### Role Test
```bash
1. Login as admin/admin
2. See "New Event" menu? ✅
3. Logout
4. Login as user/user
5. No "New Event" menu? ✅
```

## 📚 How It Works (Simple!)

### Login
```javascript
1. User enters credentials
2. POST /api/v1/auth/authenticate
3. Get back: { access_token, user }
4. Save to localStorage
5. Save to Pinia store
6. Done!
```

### API Calls
```javascript
1. Interceptor checks localStorage
2. If token exists, add to header:
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
3. Send request
4. Done!
```

### Page Refresh
```javascript
1. App.vue loads
2. Check localStorage for token + user
3. If found, load to Pinia
4. User stays logged in
5. Done!
```

### Logout
```javascript
1. Clear Pinia state
2. Clear localStorage
3. Redirect to login
4. Done!
```

That's it! No complex refresh, no retry, no queues. Just simple, straightforward authentication.

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Start Fresh
```bash
# Browser console:
localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear();
