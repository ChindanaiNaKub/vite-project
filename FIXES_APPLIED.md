# Fixes Applied - Auction Creation & Image Preview

## Date: October 5, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Admin Cannot Create Auction Items
**Problem**: Admin users could not create auction items despite having proper permissions.

**Root Cause**: The `AxiosClient` was not attaching JWT tokens to API requests. It only had `withCredentials: true` (for cookies), but the authentication system uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage.

**Solution**: Added an Axios request interceptor to automatically attach the JWT token from localStorage to all API requests.

**File Modified**: `src/services/AxiosClient.ts`

```typescript
// Add request interceptor to attach JWT token from localStorage
apiClient.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`
    }
    return config
  },
  (error) => {
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
)
```

### 2. ✅ Image Preview Not Showing for Events
**Problem**: When uploading images for events, the preview was not displaying.

**Root Cause**: The `ImageUpload` component was filtering out blob URLs, thinking they were temporary and shouldn't be used. However, blob URLs are essential for showing previews of images before they're uploaded to the backend.

**Solution**: Modified the `convertMediaToString` function to include blob URLs for preview purposes. The component now handles both:
- **Blob URLs**: Temporary local URLs created by the browser for immediate preview
- **Firebase URLs**: Permanent URLs returned by the backend after upload completes

**File Modified**: `src/components/ImageUpload.vue`

```typescript
// Include ALL URLs - blob URLs are needed for preview, Firebase URLs for persistence
// The vue-media-upload component:
// 1. First creates blob URLs for preview (local, temporary)
// 2. Then uploads to backend which returns Firebase URLs
// 3. Finally updates with Firebase URLs (permanent)
if (imageUrl && imageUrl.startsWith('blob:')) {
  console.log('✅ Adding blob URL for preview:', imageUrl)
  output.push(imageUrl)
} else if (imageUrl && (imageUrl.startsWith('http://') || imageUrl.startsWith('https://'))) {
  console.log('✅ Adding permanent Firebase URL:', imageUrl)
  output.push(imageUrl)
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Auction Creation
1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Navigate to `/add-auction` or click "Create Auction" button
3. Fill in the auction item details:
   - Description
   - Category/Type
   - Starting Bid (optional)
4. Click "Create Auction Item"
5. ✅ Should successfully create and redirect to auction list

### Test Image Preview for Events
1. Log in with appropriate credentials
2. Navigate to `/add-event` or click "Create Event" button
3. Fill in event details
4. In the "Upload images" section, click to select image files
5. ✅ Should immediately see preview of selected images
6. ✅ Submit the form - images should be uploaded and permanent URLs saved

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login → JWT Token stored in localStorage
    ↓
API Request → Interceptor adds "Authorization: Bearer {token}" header
    ↓
Backend validates token → Request succeeds
```

### Image Upload Flow
```
User selects image → Browser creates blob URL → Preview shown
    ↓
vue-media-upload uploads to backend
    ↓
Backend saves to Firebase/storage → Returns permanent URL
    ↓
Component updates with permanent URL → Saved with event/auction
```

## Impact
- ✅ Admin users can now create auction items
- ✅ All authenticated API requests now properly include JWT token
- ✅ Image previews work correctly for events (and other forms using ImageUpload)
- ✅ Both temporary (blob) and permanent (Firebase) URLs are handled properly

## Notes
- The JWT token interceptor applies to ALL API requests through AxiosClient
- Events were working because they might have been tested without the auth check, but auctions required admin role
- Image upload backend endpoint should remain publicly accessible (no auth required for the upload endpoint itself)
