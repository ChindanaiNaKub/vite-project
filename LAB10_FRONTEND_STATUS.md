## 🔧 What You Need to Do Next

### Backend Setup (from Lab 10 instructions):

1. **Firebase Console Setup**
   - Create Firebase project
   - Enable Storage
   - Note your bucket name
   - Download service account key JSON

2. **Backend Dependencies**
   - Add Google Cloud Storage Maven dependency to `pom.xml`

3. **Backend Code**
   - Create `CloudStorageHelper.java` in util package
   - Create `StorageFileDto.java` in util package
   - Create `BucketController.java` in controller package
   - Update `Event.java` entity to include `@ElementCollection List<String> images`
   - Update `EventDTO.java` to include `images` field
   - Update `Organization.java` entity if needed
   - Update `application.yml` for file size limits

4. **Backend Endpoints Required**
   - `POST /uploadImage` - Returns `StorageFileDto` with `name` field containing image URL
   - Make sure it accepts `@RequestPart(value = "image") MultipartFile`

---

## 📝 Testing Checklist

Once your backend is ready, test:

1. ✅ Upload images when creating a new event
2. ✅ See uploaded images in event detail view
3. ✅ Upload up to 5 images for organization
4. ✅ See uploaded images in organization detail view
5. ✅ Verify images are stored in Firebase Storage bucket
6. ✅ Check that image URLs are saved in database

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Upload URL**: Your frontend is configured to use `/uploadImage` endpoint (not `/uploadFile`)
2. **Response Format**: Backend must return:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "https://storage.googleapis.com/..."
   }
   ```
3. **File Size**: Remember to update `application.yml` if you get file size errors:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     servlet:
       multipart:
         max-file-size: 10MB
         max-request-size: 10MB
   ```

## 🚀 Summary

Your **frontend is completely ready**! No changes needed. Just focus on:
- Setting up Firebase
- Implementing the backend code from Lab 10 instructions
- Testing the image upload functionality

The frontend will automatically work once your backend endpoints are ready! 🎉
