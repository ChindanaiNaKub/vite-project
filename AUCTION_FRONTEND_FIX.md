## Date: October 5, 2025

## Overview
Fixed and enhanced the auction items frontend functionality to meet Lab 9 requirements.

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **BaseInput Component Enhancement**
**Problem:** BaseInput was missing proper type and placeholder handling.

**Fix:** 
- Added `type` and `placeholder` props with proper defaults
- Enhanced styling with Tailwind CSS for consistency
- Added proper label styling

**File:** `src/components/BaseInput.vue`

---

### 2. **Auction Detail View - CREATED NEW**
**Problem:** Missing individual auction item detail page (required by lab).

**Fix:** 
- Created `AuctionDetailView.vue` with complete detail display
- Shows all auction information: description, type, bids, pricing
- Displays bid history sorted by amount (highest first)
- Shows starting price (minimum bid) and successful bid
- Includes proper date/time formatting for bids
- Fallback mechanism if backend doesn't support ID-based queries

**File:** `src/views/AuctionDetailView.vue` (NEW)

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Full auction item details
- ‚úÖ Bid history with sorting
- ‚úÖ Starting price calculation from minimum bid
- ‚úÖ Successful bid display (if sold)
- ‚úÖ Status indicator (Active/Sold)
- ‚úÖ Professional styling with Tailwind CSS

---

### 3. **Clickable Auction Cards**
**Problem:** Auction cards in the list weren't clickable to view details.

**Fix:**
- Made `AuctionItemCard` clickable
- Added hover effects (border color change, cursor pointer)
- Implemented navigation to detail view on click

**File:** `src/components/AuctionItemCard.vue`

---

### 4. **Enhanced Search Functionality**
**Problem:** Search was limited to a single keyword field.

**Fix:**
- Split search into two separate fields: Description and Type
- Implements OR logic (matches description OR type)
- Added debouncing (300ms) for better performance
- Shows all matching results when searching (no pagination)
- Returns to paginated view when search is cleared
- Pre-fetches all items for instant client-side filtering

**File:** `src/views/AuctionListView.vue`

**Search Features:**
- ‚úÖ Search by description
- ‚úÖ Search by type/category
- ‚úÖ OR logic (matches either field)
- ‚úÖ Case-insensitive matching
- ‚úÖ Debounced for performance
- ‚úÖ Live filtering

---

### 5. **Router Configuration**
**Problem:** Missing route for auction detail view.

**Fix:**
- Added import for `AuctionDetailView`
- Added route `/auction/:id` with name `auction-detail`
- Configured route to pass ID as prop

**File:** `src/router/index.ts`

---

### 6. **Service Enhancement**
**Problem:** Missing method to fetch individual auction item by ID.

**Fix:**
- Added `getAuctionItemById(id)` method to service

**File:** `src/services/AuctionService.ts`

### Frontend (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ 1.10: **Frontend to show list of AuctionItems** - WORKING
