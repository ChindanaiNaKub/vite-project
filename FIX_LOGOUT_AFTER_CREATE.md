# 🚨 URGENT FIX - Getting Logged Out After Creating Auction

## Your Current Problem

✅ You can create an auction (you see it in the response)  
❌ But then you get **logged out immediately**

## Why This Happens

Looking at your console logs:

1. ✅ You successfully create the auction (HTTP 201)
2. 🔄 App tries to **refresh the token** automatically
3. ❌ Token refresh **FAILS with 403**
4. 🚪 App logs you out

### Root Cause

**Your `refresh_token` is OLD/INVALID!**

When you:
- Cleared storage earlier → Only got new `access_token`
- But `refresh_token` was **still the old one** (or you got a new one but it's not working)
- Backend database doesn't recognize the old `refresh_token`
- Refresh fails → You get logged out

---

## 🚀 QUICK FIX (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Open Browser DevTools
Press `F12`

### Step 2: Go to Console Tab

### Step 3: Clear EVERYTHING
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

Press Enter. You should see: `undefined`

### Step 4: Verify It's Cleared
```javascript
console.log('Cleared?', Object.keys(localStorage).length === 0);
```

Should show: `Cleared? true`

### Step 5: Check What Was Removed
```javascript
// Before you clear, check what you had:
console.log('Tokens before clear:');
console.log('- access_token:', localStorage.getItem('access_token')?.substring(0, 30));
console.log('- refresh_token:', localStorage.getItem('refresh_token')?.substring(0, 30));
```

### Step 6: Hard Refresh
Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Step 7: Login Again
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

### Step 8: Verify New Tokens
After login, check:
```javascript
console.log('New tokens:');
console.log('- access_token:', localStorage.getItem('access_token')?.substring(0, 30));
console.log('- refresh_token:', localStorage.getItem('refresh_token')?.substring(0, 30));
```

Both should be different from before!

### Step 9: Test Creating Auction
Try creating an auction now. You should:
- ✅ See the auction created successfully
- ✅ Stay logged in (no logout!)

## What I Fixed in the Code

### Changed File: `src/services/AxiosInrceptorSetup.ts`

**BEFORE:**
- On 403 error → Try to refresh token
- Refresh fails → Logout
- **Problem**: Both tokens are invalid, refresh will always fail

**AFTER:**
- On 403 error → Show clear error message
- Don't try to refresh (will fail anyway)
- Give user instructions to clear storage
- **Benefit**: You don't get logged out unexpectedly

## Understanding the Token Flow

### What Should Happen (Normal)
```
1. Login → Get access_token + refresh_token
2. Make API call → Use access_token
3. Access token expires → Use refresh_token to get new access_token
4. Continue working ✅
```

### What's Happening to You (Problem)
```
1. Login → Get NEW access_token + OLD refresh_token (still in storage)
2. Make API call → Use NEW access_token ✅
3. App tries to refresh → Use OLD refresh_token ❌
4. Refresh fails (403) → Logout 🚪
```

### After the Fix
```
1. Clear ALL storage → Remove OLD tokens
2. Login → Get NEW access_token + NEW refresh_token
3. Make API call → Use NEW access_token ✅
4. If needed, refresh → Use NEW refresh_token ✅
5. Everything works! 🎉
```

## Verification Checklist

After following the fix:

- [ ] Cleared localStorage and sessionStorage completely
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Logged in again
- [ ] Verified both tokens are stored (check DevTools → Application → Local Storage)
- [ ] Both tokens are NEW (different from before)
- [ ] Created an auction successfully
- [ ] **Did NOT get logged out** ✅
- [ ] Console shows no 403 errors on token refresh

---

## Prevention

### Always Clear Storage When Backend Resets

When you know the backend database was reset:

```javascript
// Run this in browser console BEFORE logging in
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Or Use Incognito Mode

For testing after backend reset:
1. Open **Incognito/Private window**
2. Go to your app
3. Login fresh
4. Test everything

This ensures no old tokens interfere!

---

## If You're Still Getting Logged Out

### 1. Check Your Tokens
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('access_token:', localStorage.getItem('access_token'));
console.log('refresh_token:', localStorage.getItem('refresh_token'));
```

Both should start with `eyJ` (valid JWT format)

### 2. Check Network Tab
- Open DevTools → Network
- Try to create auction
- Look for any `/refresh` or `/auth/refresh` calls
- Check if they're failing with 403

### 3. Check Console for Errors
Look for these patterns:
```
❌ Token refresh failed with error
❌ Request failed with status code 403
🔄 Attempting token refresh...
```

If you see these, your refresh token is still invalid!

### 4. Nuclear Option - Clear Everything
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
document.cookie.split(";").forEach(c => {
  document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/");
});
location.reload();
```

```bash
./fix-logout-issue.sh
```

It will:
- Explain the problem
- Give you step-by-step instructions
- Verify backend is working
- Help you understand why it happened

## Summary

**The Problem:**
- Old `refresh_token` in storage
- Token refresh fails
- Auto-logout happens

**The Solution:**
- Clear ALL storage
- Login fresh
- Get both new tokens

**The Fix:**
- Updated code to not auto-logout on 403
- Shows clear error messages
- Guides you to clear storage

**Do This Now:**
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```
Then hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) and login again!

## After the Fix

Once you've cleared storage and logged in fresh:

✅ You can create auctions  
✅ You stay logged in  
✅ Token refresh works (when needed)  
✅ No unexpected logouts  

🎉 **Problem solved!**
