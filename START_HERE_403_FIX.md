## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Axios Interceptor
**File:** `src/services/AxiosInrceptorSetup.ts`

**New features:**
- ✅ Detailed logging for every request
- ✅ Shows when token is added
- ✅ Warns when token is missing
- ✅ Token preview in console logs

**Example logs you'll see:**
```
✅ Adding Authorization header to request: /auction-items
🔑 Token (first 50 chars): eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

### 2. Added 403 Error Handling

**New features:**
- ✅ Comprehensive 403 error logging
- ✅ Automatic token refresh attempt
- ✅ Clear diagnosis in console
- ✅ Auto-logout on persistent failures

**Example error logs:**
```
🚫 403 FORBIDDEN Error!
📋 Details: { url, method, hasToken, tokenPreview }
💡 This usually means:
   1. Token is invalid or expired
   2. Token doesn't exist in backend database
🔧 Solution: Clear storage and login again
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging Your Issue

### Check if Backend is Working
```bash
# Quick test
./test-frontend-fix.sh

# Should show:
# ✓ Backend is reachable
# ✓ Authentication successful
# ✓ Auction created successfully
```

If all pass ✅ → Backend is fine, issue is frontend

### Check Browser Network Tab

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Try to create an auction
4. Find POST request to `/auction-items`
5. Check **Headers** → **Request Headers**
6. Look for: `Authorization: Bearer eyJ...`

**If Authorization header is missing:**
- Check console for errors
- Make sure you logged in after clearing storage

**If Authorization header is present but still 403:**
- Token is invalid
- Clear storage again and login

### Check Browser Console

You should see detailed logs like:
```
✅ Adding Authorization header to request: /auction-items
🔑 Token (first 50 chars): eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
✅ Request successful: /auction-items Status: 201
```

If you see warnings or errors, follow the instructions in the console.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:

- [ ] Backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`
- [ ] Frontend is running: `curl http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Ran `./test-frontend-fix.sh` → All tests pass ✓
- [ ] Cleared browser storage
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser
- [ ] Logged in from frontend
- [ ] Token stored in localStorage (check DevTools → Application → Local Storage)
- [ ] Can create auctions without 403 errors ✓

## 💡 Why This Happened

### Root Cause:
```
Backend database was reset
  ↓
Old tokens in frontend storage no longer valid
  ↓
Frontend sends old token
  ↓
Backend can't validate token
  ↓
Backend returns 403 Forbidden
```

### The Fix:
```
Clear storage
  ↓
Login again
  ↓
Get new valid token
  ↓
Backend validates token ✓
  ↓
Everything works! 🎉
```

## 🛡️ Prevention

To avoid this in the future:

### When Backend Database is Reset:
1. Immediately clear frontend storage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   ```

2. Or use Quick Fix button in `test-frontend-auth.html`

3. Or restart browser in incognito mode
