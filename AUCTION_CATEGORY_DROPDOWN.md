# Auction Category Dropdown - Update

## What Changed?

The **Type/Category** field in the auction creation form has been upgraded from a free-text input to a **dropdown menu** with predefined categories.

## Before (Text Input)
```vue
<input 
  v-model="auctionItem.type" 
  type="text" 
  placeholder="e.g., Electronics, Art, Collectibles..." 
/>
```
Users could type anything, leading to inconsistent categories.

## After (Dropdown Menu)
```vue
<select v-model="auctionItem.type">
  <option value="" disabled selected>Select a category...</option>
  <option v-for="category in categories" :key="category" :value="category">
    {{ category }}
  </option>
</select>
```
Users must select from predefined categories for consistency.

## Available Categories

The dropdown includes **13 categories**:

1. 📱 **Electronics** - Computers, phones, cameras, gadgets
2. 🎨 **Art** - Paintings, sculptures, prints, photography
3. 💎 **Collectibles** - Rare items, limited editions, memorabilia
4. ⚽ **Sports** - Equipment, jerseys, signed items
5. 💍 **Jewelry** - Rings, necklaces, watches, accessories
6. 📚 **Books** - Rare books, first editions, manuscripts
7. 🛋️ **Furniture** - Chairs, tables, cabinets, home decor
8. 🚗 **Vehicles** - Cars, motorcycles, boats
9. 👗 **Fashion** - Clothing, shoes, designer items
10. 🏺 **Antiques** - Historical items, vintage pieces
11. 🎵 **Music** - Instruments, vinyl records, concert memorabilia
12. 🧸 **Toys** - Action figures, board games, vintage toys
13. 📦 **Other** - Anything that doesn't fit above

```typescript
const categories = [
  'Electronics',
  'Art',
  'Collectibles',
  'Sports',
  // Add new categories here
  'Your New Category',
]
```

## Visual Appearance

The dropdown has been styled to match the rest of the form:
- ✅ Same border and padding as other fields
- ✅ Focus ring (green) when selected
- ✅ White background
- ✅ Full width
- ✅ Placeholder text: "Select a category..."
- ✅ Required field validation
