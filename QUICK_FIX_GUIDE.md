## 🔧 What Was Fixed

| Component | What Changed |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Auth Store** | Added `initializeAuth()` to load tokens on startup |
| **Main App** | Calls `initializeAuth()` before mounting app |
| **Login** | Enhanced logging to track token storage |
| **Logout** | Improved cleanup of all auth state |

---

## 📝 Console Commands

### Check Storage
```javascript
console.log('Access Token:', localStorage.getItem('access_token'))
console.log('Refresh Token:', localStorage.getItem('refresh_token'))
console.log('User:', localStorage.getItem('user'))
```

### Clear Storage
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### Verify Token Format
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')
if (token) {
  const parts = token.split('.')
  if (parts.length === 3) {
    const payload = JSON.parse(atob(parts[1]))
    console.log('Token Payload:', payload)
    console.log('Expires:', new Date(payload.exp * 1000))
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clear old tokens
- [ ] Restart dev server
- [ ] Login successfully
- [ ] Refresh page - still logged in?
- [ ] Create auction - returns 201?
- [ ] Logout - everything cleared?
- [ ] Login again - works?

## 🐛 Debug Tools

### Interactive Debug Page
```bash
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8888
# Open: http://localhost:8888/debug-auth.html
```

### Check Logs in Console
Look for these emojis:
- 🔄 = Loading tokens
- ✅ = Success
- ❌ = Error
- 🔐 = Login attempt
- 💾 = Saving to storage
- 🚪 = Logout

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Why Tokens Were Lost
```
Before:
Login → Save to localStorage → Page Refresh → State lost ❌

After:
Login → Save to localStorage → Page Refresh → Load from localStorage ✅
```

### The Fix
```typescript
// In main.ts - runs on EVERY app startup
const authStore = useAuthStore()
authStore.initializeAuth() // ← This is the magic!
```

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: Still getting 403 errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear everything and start fresh
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
# Hard refresh
Ctrl + Shift + R
# Login again
```

### Issue: Token exists but not working
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check if token is expired
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')
const parts = token.split('.')
const payload = JSON.parse(atob(parts[1]))
console.log('Expired?', new Date(payload.exp * 1000) < new Date())
```

### Issue: Can't see console logs
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev

# Open browser DevTools
Press F12 → Console tab

# Logs should appear with emojis 🔄 ✅ ❌
```

## 📚 Files to Check

| File | What to Look For |
|------|------------------|
| `src/stores/auth.ts` | `initializeAuth()` method exists |
| `src/main.ts` | `authStore.initializeAuth()` is called |
| Browser → DevTools → Application → Local Storage | Has `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `user` |
| Browser → DevTools → Console | Shows 🔄 and ✅ logs |

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. **On Login:**
   ```
   🔐 Attempting login for: your@email.com
   ✅ Login successful, storing tokens
   💾 Tokens saved to localStorage
   ```

2. **On Page Refresh:**
   ```
   🔄 Initializing auth from localStorage...
   ✅ Auth initialized from localStorage
   ```

3. **On Create Auction:**
   ```
   ✅ Adding Authorization header to request
   ✅ Request successful: /api/v1/auctions Status: 201
   ```

4. **Visual Confirmation:**
   - You stay logged in after refresh ✅
   - Create auction returns 201 ✅
   - No 403 errors ✅
   - Can navigate freely ✅
