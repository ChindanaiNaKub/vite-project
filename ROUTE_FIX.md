# Route Fix - /events Issue Resolved

## 🐛 Problem

After login or registration, users were redirected to `/events` which showed a 404 "Oops!" error page.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The router configuration had:
- ✅ `/` (root) → EventListView 
- ❌ **No `/events` route defined**

But the login and registration components were redirecting to `/events`, causing a 404.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Redirect Paths
Changed the redirect destination in both LoginView and RegisterView:
- **Before**: `router.push('/events')`
- **After**: `router.push('/')`

### 2. Added Route Alias
Added an alias to the root route so `/events` also works:
```typescript
{
  path: '/',
  name: 'event-list-view',
  component: EventListView,
  alias: '/events', // Now /events works too!
  props: (route) => { ... }
}
```

## 🎯 Result

Now both paths work correctly:
- ✅ `http://localhost:5174/` → Event List
- ✅ `http://localhost:5174/events` → Event List (same page)
- ✅ Login → Redirects to `/` → Shows Event List
- ✅ Register → Redirects to `/` → Shows Event List

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **src/views/LoginView.vue**
   - Changed redirect from `/events` to `/`

2. **src/views/RegisterView.vue**
   - Changed redirect from `/events` to `/`

3. **src/router/index.ts**
   - Added `alias: '/events'` to root route

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Test Login Flow**:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5174/login
   Login with: admin / admin
   Expected: Redirects to / and shows event list
   ```

2. **Test Registration Flow**:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5174/register
   Register new user
   Expected: Redirects to / and shows event list
   ```

3. **Test Direct /events Access**:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5174/events
   Expected: Shows event list (same as /)
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Your dev server is now running on PORT 5174** (not 5173)

This happened because port 5173 was already in use.

Access your app at:
- 🌐 http://localhost:5174/
- 🌐 http://localhost:5174/events
- 🔐 http://localhost:5174/login
- ✍️ http://localhost:5174/register

## ✅ Verification

- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Routes configured correctly
- [x] Login redirects work
- [x] Register redirects work
- [x] /events alias works
- [x] Dev server running
