# Quick Diagnosis: Why You're Getting Redirected to Login

## What's Happening

You're seeing "admin admin" in the navbar (you ARE logged in), but when you try to create an auction, you're being redirected to the login page.

## Root Cause

The user account you're logged in with **doesn't have ROLE_ADMIN privileges**, so the backend returns 403 Forbidden. The frontend is correctly showing this as a permission error, but then something is redirecting you to the login page.

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Current User's Roles

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
if (token) {
  const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
  console.log('Your roles:', payload.roles);
}
```

**Expected for admin**: `["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"]`  
**If you see**: `["ROLE_USER"]` or `undefined` ‚Üí That's the problem!

### Step 2: Check Who You're Logged In As

```javascript
console.log('Logged in as:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));
```

### Step 3: Test Backend Authentication

Try logging in with known credentials:

```bash
# Test if admin user exists and has correct password
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'

# Or try with email:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin@admin.com","password":"admin"}'
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Logout and Re-login (Quick Test)

1. Click "LogOut" in the navbar
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Try to register a new account
4. Check if that works

### Solution 2: Find Correct Admin Credentials

The backend should have an admin user. Check:
- Backend startup logs for default admin creation
- `InitApp.java` or similar initialization files in backend
- Backend README or documentation

### Solution 3: Grant Admin Role to Your Current User

If you have backend access, modify `AuthenticationService.java` temporarily:

```java
// In the register() method, find this line:
.roles(List.of(Role.ROLE_USER))

// Change it to:
.roles(List.of(Role.ROLE_USER, Role.ROLE_ADMIN))
```

Then:
1. Restart backend
2. Register a new account
3. That account will have admin privileges
4. **Remember to change it back!**

### Solution 4: Check If Backend Has Your Admin User

Run this in terminal:
```bash
# Create a test admin user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username":"testadmin",
    "email":"testadmin@example.com",
    "password":"admin123",
    "firstname":"Test",
    "lastname":"Admin"
  }'
```

This will create a user with ROLE_USER. You'll need to modify the backend to grant ROLE_ADMIN as shown in Solution 3.

## Why You're Being Redirected

Looking at the screenshot, you're on the login page but still show as logged in. This could be because:

1. **Browser cache issue** - Old login state cached
2. **Route guard confusion** - Router thinks you need to login
3. **Error in navigation** - Something triggered navigation to login

## Immediate Action

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Run the commands** from Step 1 & 2 above
3. **Share the output** - I can then tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Try logging out completely** and re-logging in

## Expected Console Output (for admin user)

```javascript
// Step 1 output (GOOD):
Your roles: ["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"]

// Step 1 output (BAD - this is probably what you have):
Your roles: ["ROLE_USER"]
// or
Your roles: undefined

// Step 2 output:
Logged in as: {
  id: 1,
  name: "admin admin",
  roles: ["ROLE_USER"]  // ‚Üê Missing ROLE_ADMIN!
}
```

## Next Steps

Please run the console commands and share:
1. What roles your current token has
2. The output of the authentication test (curl command)
3. Whether you can find admin credentials in backend logs

Then I can provide the exact solution! üéØ
