# üîß Backend Fix for 403 Upload Error - STEP BY STEP

## The Problem
Your backend is rejecting image uploads with a **403 Forbidden** error because Spring Security's authorization filter is blocking anonymous requests to the upload endpoints.

## The Solution
You need to modify **TWO files** in your backend to properly handle anonymous uploads.

---

## Step 1: Fix JwtAuthenticationFilter.java

### Location
`/home/prab/Documents/CMU/ComponentBasedSoftware/331-Backend/src/main/java/se331/lab/security/config/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`

### What to do

1. **Add these imports at the top of the file:**

```java
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AnonymousAuthenticationToken;
import org.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthority;
```

2. **Find the upload endpoint bypass code** (should look like this):

```java
// Allow upload endpoints without requiring JWT auth
if (path.equals("/uploadImage") || path.equals("/uploadFile")) {
  filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
  return;
}
```

3. **Replace it with this:**

```java
// Allow upload endpoints without requiring JWT auth
if (path.equals("/uploadImage") || path.equals("/uploadFile")) {
  // Set anonymous authentication to satisfy authorization filter
  AnonymousAuthenticationToken anonymousAuth = 
      new AnonymousAuthenticationToken(
          "anonymous", "anonymous", 
          java.util.Collections.singletonList(
              new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_ANONYMOUS")
          )
      );
  SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(anonymousAuth);
  filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
  return;
}
```

**Why this works:** This explicitly sets an anonymous authentication token in the security context, which satisfies Spring Security's authorization filter requirements while still bypassing JWT validation.

## Step 2: Verify SecurityConfiguration.java

### Location
`/home/prab/Documents/CMU/ComponentBasedSoftware/331-Backend/src/main/java/se331/lab/security/config/SecurityConfiguration.java`

### What to check

Make sure your `securityFilterChain` method has **permitAll()** for upload endpoints:

```java
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
  http
    // ... other config ...
    .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
      .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/uploadImage", "/uploadFile").permitAll()
      // ... other matchers ...
    )
    // ... other config ...
}
```

### Optional: Alternative Fix (Nuclear Option)

If the above doesn't work, you can add this bean method to **completely bypass** security for upload endpoints:

```java
@Bean
public WebSecurityCustomizer webSecurityCustomizer() {
  return (web) -> web.ignoring()
      .requestMatchers("/uploadImage", "/uploadFile");
}
```

This tells Spring Security to completely skip ALL security filters for these endpoints.

## Step 3: Restart Backend

After making changes:

```bash
cd /home/prab/Documents/CMU/ComponentBasedSoftware/331-Backend

# Stop the running backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

# Clean and restart
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
# or if you're using Gradle:
./gradlew clean bootRun
```

---

## Step 4: Test the Fix

### Quick Terminal Test

```bash
# Test without any authentication
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/uploadImage \
  -F "image=@/path/to/any/image.png"
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Should return 200/201 with Firebase URL
- ‚úÖ Or return 500 with Firebase error (if credentials aren't configured)
- ‚ùå Should **NOT** return 403 Forbidden

### Test from Frontend

1. Refresh your Vue app in the browser
2. Try uploading an image
3. Check the console - you should see:
   - "Not sending Authorization header for upload (endpoint should be public)"
   - No 403 errors
   - Either success or a different error (like Firebase configuration issues)

---

## What We Changed in Frontend

‚úÖ **Already fixed in your vite-project:**
- Removed Authorization header from upload requests
- The ImageUpload component now sends requests without authentication

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting 403?

1. **Check if backend restarted properly**
   ```bash
   # Look for this in backend logs:
   # "Started Application in X.XXX seconds"
   ```

2. **Verify the changes were saved**
   ```bash
   cd /home/prab/Documents/CMU/ComponentBasedSoftware/331-Backend
   grep -A 5 "AnonymousAuthenticationToken" src/main/java/se331/lab/security/config/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java
   ```
   Should show your new code.

3. **Check backend logs for errors**
   Look in the terminal where backend is running for any stack traces.

### Getting 500 errors?

That's actually **progress**! A 500 error means:
- ‚úÖ Authentication/authorization is working
- ‚ùå Firebase/cloud storage configuration issue
- Check your `application.yml` or `application.properties` for cloud storage credentials

### Getting CORS errors?

Make sure your CORS config allows requests from `http://localhost:5173`:

```java
@Bean
public CorsConfigurationSource corsConfigurationSource() {
  CorsConfiguration configuration = new CorsConfiguration();
  configuration.addAllowedOrigin("http://localhost:5173");
  configuration.addAllowedMethod("*");
  configuration.addAllowedHeader("*");
  configuration.setAllowCredentials(true);
  // ... rest of config
}
```

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd /home/prab/Documents/CMU/ComponentBasedSoftware/331-Backend

# Edit the JWT filter
nano src/main/java/se331/lab/security/config/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java
# or
code src/main/java/se331/lab/security/config/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java

# Restart backend
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run

# Test upload in another terminal
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/uploadImage -F "image=@test.png"
```

---

## Summary

1. ‚úÖ Frontend already fixed (no Authorization header sent)
2. üîß Backend needs fix: Set anonymous authentication in JWT filter
3. üîÑ Restart backend after changes
4. ‚úÖ Test with curl or browser

The root cause is that Spring Security with STATELESS sessions requires an authentication object in the security context, even for `permitAll()` endpoints. By explicitly setting an anonymous authentication token, we satisfy this requirement.
