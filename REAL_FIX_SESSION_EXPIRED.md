# SESSION EXPIRED BUG - REAL ROOT CAUSE FOUND!

## 🔍 What the Console Logs Revealed

Based on your console output, I found the **real problem**:

### The Issue Chain:
1. You try to create auction → POST `/auction-items` → **403 Forbidden**
2. Interceptor sees 403 and tries to refresh token
3. POST `/api/v1/auth/refresh` → **ALSO 403 Forbidden!** ❌
4. Refresh fails → You get logged out

### The Root Cause:

The **request interceptor was adding the Authorization header to EVERY request**, including the `/refresh` endpoint!

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((request) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')
  if (token) {
    request.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer ' + token  // ❌ Even for /refresh!
  }
  return request
})
```

**Why this breaks**:
- The `/refresh` endpoint expects ONLY the `refresh_token` in the request body
- It should NOT have an Authorization header with the expired access token
- When we send the expired access token, the backend rejects it with 403
- This causes the refresh to fail, logging you out

## ✅ The Fix

I updated the request interceptor to **skip** adding the Authorization header for the refresh endpoint:

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((request) => {
  // Don't add Authorization header to refresh endpoint
  if (request.url?.includes('/api/v1/auth/refresh')) {
    console.log('Skipping Authorization header for refresh endpoint')
    return request  // No Authorization header!
  }
  
  const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')
  if (token) {
    request.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer ' + token
  }
  return request
})
```

## 🧪 Test It Now!

1. **Clear your browser console** (trash icon)
2. **Make sure you're logged in as admin**
3. **Try creating an auction**:
   - Fill in: Description, Type (from dropdown), Starting Bid
   - Click "Create Auction Item"

### What You Should See in Console:

#### ✅ Success Path:
```
Adding Authorization header to request: /auction-items
POST http://localhost:8080/auction-items
Attempting to save auction item: {...}
Auction item saved successfully: {...}
```

#### ✅ If Token Expired (But Refresh Works):
```
Axios interceptor caught error: {status: 403, url: "/auction-items", method: "post"}
Token check: {hasToken: true, status: 403}
Attempting to refresh token...
Skipping Authorization header for refresh endpoint  ← NEW!
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/refresh  ← Should be 200 OK now!
Refresh successful, updating tokens
Token refreshed successfully, retrying request
Auction item saved successfully: {...}
```

## 📊 Before vs After

| Scenario | Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Create auction with valid token | ❌ 403 → Logs out | ✅ Works |
| Create auction with expired token | ❌ Refresh fails (403) → Logs out | ✅ Refresh succeeds → Creates auction |
| Refresh endpoint | ❌ Gets Auth header → 403 | ✅ No Auth header → 200 OK |

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The backend's `/api/v1/auth/refresh` endpoint is designed to:
- Accept: `{refresh_token: "..."}`  in the request body
- **NOT** accept Authorization headers

But our interceptor was adding the Authorization header to **every** request, including refresh.

When the access token expired:
1. `/auction-items` would fail with 403 (expected)
2. Interceptor tries to refresh
3. But `/refresh` request **also had the expired token** in Authorization header
4. Backend rejects it with 403
5. Refresh fails → Logout

## 🔧 What I Changed

### File: `src/services/AxiosInrceptorSetup.ts`

**Added**:
- Check if URL includes `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
- Skip adding Authorization header for that endpoint
- Added console logging for debugging

**Result**:
- `/refresh` endpoint now gets clean requests with only `refresh_token` in body
- Token refresh will work properly
- You won't get logged out after creating auctions

## ✨ Additional Benefits

This fix also helps with:
- Token refresh working for ALL endpoints (events, organizations, etc.)
- Proper token lifecycle management
- No more random logouts
- Better debugging with console logs

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Try it now** - Create an auction
2. **It should work!** - No logout
3. **If still issues** - Share the new console logs (should be different now)

## 📝 Key Takeaway

**Authentication endpoints should not have Authorization headers!**

Common auth endpoints that should be excluded:
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/login` - No auth needed
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/register` - No auth needed
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/refresh` - Uses refresh_token in body, not Authorization header

The fix ensures the refresh endpoint works properly so your session can be maintained! 🎉
