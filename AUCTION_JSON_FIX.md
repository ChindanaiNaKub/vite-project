# ✅ Auction Item JSON Structure Fixed

## Problem Solved
The frontend was sending an incorrect JSON structure with a `startingBid` field that doesn't exist in the backend model.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AuctionFormView.vue** - Removed Starting Bid Field

#### Removed from Template:
- Removed the entire "Starting Bid (optional)" input field
- This field was causing the backend to receive incorrect data

#### Updated Component State:
```typescript
// BEFORE ❌
const auctionItem = ref<Partial<AuctionItem>>({
  description: '',
  type: '',
  successfulBid: 0  // ← This was wrong!
})

// AFTER ✅
const auctionItem = ref<Partial<AuctionItem>>({
  description: '',
  type: ''
  // successfulBid removed
})
```

#### Updated saveAuction Function:
```typescript
function saveAuction() {
  // Only send description and type
  const payload = {
    description: auctionItem.value.description,
    type: auctionItem.value.type
  }
  
  AuctionService.saveAuctionItem(payload)
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

## JSON Structure Now Sent

### ✅ Correct (Current)
```json
{
  "description": "Gaming Laptop",
  "type": "Electronics"
}
```

### ❌ Wrong (Previous)
```json
{
  "description": "Gaming Laptop",
  "type": "Electronics",
  "startingBid": 324  // ← Backend couldn't parse this
}
```

## Backend Model Reference

```java
public class AuctionItem {
    Long id;              // Auto-generated
    String description;   // ✅ Required
    String type;          // ✅ Required
    List<Bid> bids;       // Managed separately
    Bid successfulBid;    // Set when auction ends
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Backend expects only 2 fields**: `description` and `type`
2. **Bids are managed separately**: Bids are added through a different endpoint
3. **successfulBid is set later**: When the auction closes, the backend sets this
4. **No startingBid field exists**: The backend model doesn't have this field at all

## Test the Fix

### Frontend Test:
1. Go to Create Auction page
2. Fill in Description and Type
3. Submit the form
4. Should successfully create auction item

### Backend Test (Already Working):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auction-items \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"description":"Test Item","type":"Electronics"}'
```

**Expected Result:** `200 OK` ✅

## Files Modified

1. `/src/views/AuctionFormView.vue`
   - Removed starting bid input field
   - Updated component state to only include description and type
   - Modified saveAuction to explicitly send only required fields

## Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Form Fields** | Description, Type, Starting Bid | Description, Type |
| **JSON Sent** | `{description, type, successfulBid}` | `{description, type}` |
| **Backend Error** | ❌ JSON parse error | ✅ Working |
| **Status** | ❌ 400 Bad Request | ✅ 200 OK (expected) |

The frontend now sends the correct JSON structure that matches the backend's expectations!
