## What to Do Next

### 1. Clear Browser Data
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
```

### 2. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Basic Login
- [ ] Go to http://localhost:5173/login
- [ ] Enter: admin / admin
- [ ] Click "Sign in"
- [ ] Should redirect to event list
- [ ] Should see "admin" in navbar
- [ ] Should see "New Event" menu

### 4. Test Persistence
- [ ] Press F5 to refresh page
- [ ] Should still be logged in
- [ ] Should still see user name
- [ ] Should still see "New Event" menu

### 5. Test API Calls
- [ ] Open DevTools > Network tab
- [ ] Navigate to different pages
- [ ] Check requests have: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- [ ] Responses should be successful (200/201)

### 6. Test Logout
- [ ] Click "LogOut" in navbar
- [ ] Should redirect to login page
- [ ] localStorage should be empty
- [ ] Should not see user name anymore

### 7. Test User Role
- [ ] Logout if logged in
- [ ] Login as: user / user
- [ ] Should NOT see "New Event" menu
- [ ] Should see user name in navbar
- [ ] Logout

## Verification Commands

### Check TypeScript
```bash
npm run type-check
# Should complete without errors
```

### Check Linting (optional)
```bash
npm run lint
# Should pass or show only minor warnings
```

### Check Build (optional)
```bash
npm run build
# Should build successfully
```

## Success Criteria

### Must Work
- [x] âœ… TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] âœ… Login works with admin/admin
- [ ] âœ… Login works with user/user
- [ ] âœ… Page refresh keeps login
- [ ] âœ… Logout clears everything
- [ ] âœ… Admin sees "New Event" menu
- [ ] âœ… User doesn't see "New Event" menu
- [ ] âœ… API calls include Authorization header

### Should Work
- [ ] âœ… No console errors
- [ ] âœ… Smooth navigation
- [ ] âœ… Create event works (admin only)
- [ ] âœ… Create auction works (admin only)
- [ ] âœ… Form validation works
- [ ] âœ… Error messages display

### Nice to Have (Not Required)
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] No lint warnings
- [ ] All routes accessible

## Troubleshooting

### If login doesn't work:
```bash
# 1. Check backend is running (port 8080)
# 2. Check VITE_BACKEND_URL in .env
# 3. Clear storage and try again
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### If page refresh logs you out:
```bash
# 1. Check App.vue has localStorage loading
# 2. Check auth store has token and user
# 3. Clear storage and login fresh
```

### If 403 errors appear:
```bash
# 1. Token might be expired (after 24 hours)
# 2. Clear storage and login again
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### If "New Event" menu doesn't show for admin:
```javascript
// Check in console:
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))
// Should show: { ..., roles: ['ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_USER'] }
```
