# Session Expired Fix - Final Solution

## Problem Summary
When users try to create an auction item, they get **403 Forbidden** error and are **immediately logged out with "session expired"** message.

## Root Causes

### 1. Frontend Issue (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: The Axios interceptor was treating **403 (Forbidden)** errors the same as **401 (Unauthorized)** errors, attempting to refresh the token for both.

**Why this was wrong**:
- **401 (Unauthorized)** = Token is expired or invalid → Try to refresh token
- **403 (Forbidden)** = User is authenticated but doesn't have permission → Don't refresh token

**Fix Applied**:
Modified `/src/services/AxiosInrceptorSetup.ts` to only attempt token refresh for **401 errors**, not 403 errors.

```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
if (error.response?.status === 401 || error.response?.status === 403) {
  // Try to refresh token...
}

// After (CORRECT):
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  // Only refresh for 401 errors
}
```

### 2. Backend Issue (NEEDS FIX ⚠️)
**Problem**: The Spring Boot backend's SecurityConfig is returning **403 Forbidden** when admin users try to POST to `/auction-items`.

**Why this happens**:
- The backend's security configuration doesn't allow ROLE_ADMIN to POST to `/auction-items`
- Or the JWT token doesn't contain the ROLE_ADMIN authority correctly

## What You Need to Do

### Option A: Fix the Backend (Recommended)
You need to update your Spring Boot backend's `SecurityConfig` to allow ROLE_ADMIN users to create auction items:

```java
http
    .authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -> authorize
        // ... other rules ...
        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/auction-items/**").permitAll()
        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/auction-items").hasRole("ADMIN")  // ← Add this
        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.PUT, "/auction-items/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE, "/auction-items/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        // ... other rules ...
    )
```

Also ensure your JWT token includes the correct roles. Check:
1. When user logs in, does the JWT include `roles: ["ROLE_ADMIN"]`?
2. Does the JwtAuthenticationFilter properly extract roles from the token?

### Option B: Test with Current Setup
Try these diagnostic steps:

1. **Check your JWT token contents**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console after logging in:
   const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token')
   const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]))
   console.log(payload)
   ```
   
   You should see something like:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "admin@example.com",
     "roles": ["ROLE_ADMIN"],
     "iat": 1234567890,
     "exp": 1234567890
   }
   ```

2. **Test the endpoint directly**:
   ```bash
   # Get your token
   TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/authenticate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin@example.com","password":"admin"}' \
     | jq -r '.access_token')
   
   # Try to create auction
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auction-items \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"description":"Test auction","type":"Electronics","successfulBid":0}'
   ```
   
   Expected result: **201 Created** (not 403)

## Current Status

✅ **Frontend Fixed**: Won't incorrectly try to refresh token on 403 errors  
⚠️ **Backend Issue Remains**: Still returns 403 for POST /auction-items

## Testing After Backend Fix

Once you fix the backend:

1. Restart backend server
2. Login as admin user
3. Navigate to "Create Auction"
4. Fill in the form and submit
5. Should see success message and redirect to auction list
6. Should NOT see "session expired" or be logged out
