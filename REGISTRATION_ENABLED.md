# ✅ Registration Feature Re-enabled

## 🔄 Update: October 5, 2025

User registration has been **re-enabled** while keeping the simplified architecture.

---

## ✅ What Was Added Back

### 1. **Auth Store - Register Method**
```typescript
register(userData: {
  username: string
  email: string
  password: string
  firstname: string
  lastname: string
}) {
  return apiClient
    .post('/api/v1/auth/register', userData)
    .then((response) => {
      this.token = response.data.access_token
      this.user = response.data.user
      localStorage.setItem('access_token', this.token as string)
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(this.user))
      return response
    })
}
```

### 2. **RegisterView - Full Functionality**
- ✅ Complete registration form
- ✅ Full validation (username, email, password, confirm password, firstname, lastname)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Success message
- ✅ Auto-login after registration
- ✅ Redirect to event list

---

## 🎯 Current Features

### Authentication
- ✅ **Login** - Simple JWT authentication
- ✅ **Registration** - Create new user account
- ✅ **Logout** - Clear session
- ✅ **Token Storage** - localStorage persistence
- ✅ **Role-based UI** - Admin vs User views

### What's Still Simple
- ✅ No token refresh mechanism (keeping it simple)
- ✅ No session expiry detection (keeping it simple)
- ✅ No auto-logout on errors (keeping it simple)
- ✅ Direct localStorage loading on refresh (keeping it simple)

## 🔍 What's in Each View

### Login View (`/login`)
- Email input with validation
- Password input with validation
- "Sign in" button
- Link to registration: "Try to register here"
- Link to about page

### Register View (`/register`)
- Username input with validation
- Email input with validation
- Password input with validation
- Confirm password input with validation
- First name input with validation
- Last name input with validation
- "Create Account" button
- Link to login: "Already have an account? Sign in"

---

## 🎨 UI Components Used

Both views use the same simple components:
- `InputText.vue` - Text input with error display
- `ErrorMessage.vue` - Error message component
- Form validation via `vee-validate` + `yup`

---

## 💡 How Registration Works

```
User fills form
    ↓
Client-side validation (yup)
    ↓
POST /api/v1/auth/register
    ↓
Backend creates user
    ↓
Backend returns: { access_token, user }
    ↓
Frontend stores token + user (same as login)
    ↓
Frontend redirects to event list
    ↓
User is logged in! ✅
```

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 6 characters (can increase if needed)
- Maximum 100 characters
- Must match confirmation

### Backend Validation
- Backend will also validate (double check)
- Backend may reject duplicate usernames/emails
- Backend may have additional security rules

---

## ✅ Updated File List

## 🎯 Quick Start with Registration

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Clear old data (in browser console - F12)
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()

# 3. Test Registration
# Go to: http://localhost:5173/register
# Fill in form with new user details
# Click "Create Account"
# Should be logged in and redirected!

# 4. Test Login
# Logout
# Go to: http://localhost:5173/login
# Login with new user credentials
# Should work!
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Registration

### Problem: "Registration failed"
**Check:**
- Backend is running (port 8080)
- Backend has `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint
- VITE_BACKEND_URL is correct in .env
- Network tab shows the request

### Problem: Validation errors won't clear
**Solution:**
- Fix the field error
- Error should clear automatically
- Check console for validation messages

### Problem: Can't login after registration
**Solution:**
- Check credentials are correct
- Check token was stored in localStorage
- Try clearing storage and registering again

## ✅ Summary

### What We Have Now
1. ✅ **Simplified Architecture** (no complex token refresh)
2. ✅ **Full Authentication** (login + register + logout)
3. ✅ **Simple Token Storage** (localStorage)
4. ✅ **Role-based UI** (admin features)
5. ✅ **Form Validation** (client-side with yup)
6. ✅ **Clean Code** (easy to understand)

### What We Don't Have (By Design)
1. ❌ Token refresh mechanism (keeping simple)
2. ❌ Session expiry detection (keeping simple)
3. ❌ Auto-logout on errors (keeping simple)
4. ❌ Request retry logic (keeping simple)
